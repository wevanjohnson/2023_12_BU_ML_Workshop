# Boston University Machine Learning Workshop
These are the materials for our BU Machine learning workshop at Boston University on 12/11/2023. Hopefully they are helpful!

## Things you should know about this course

* Lots of diverse material and new concepts will be covered in this course
    + Machine Learning is __NOT__ a spectator sport! You need to practice the skills you learn over and over again!
* Communication: if you have questions or concerns, please email us: <w.evan.johnson@rutgers.edu> or <vkola@bu.edu>
* Materials for the course:
    + All materials for this course will be posted on the course GitHub page: [https://github.com/wevanjohnson/2023_12_BU_ML_Workshop/edit/main/README.md)](https://github.com/wevanjohnson/2023_12_BU_ML_Workshop/edit/main/README.md)
    + You obviously have this since you are here!
* Dependencies (R packages to install and datasets to download): 
    + Please install the following R packages for Data Management: `tidyverse`, `DT`, `gridExtra`, `dslabs` (Rafa Irizarry’s datasets for his Data Science book!)​. In R: `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "DT", "gridExtra", "dslabs"))`
    + ​Please install the following R packages for Machine learning: ​`caret`, `e1071`, `rpart`, `randomForest`, `neuralnet`. In R: `install.packages(c("caret", "e1071", "rpart", "randomForest", "neuralnet"))` ​
    + You will need the following datasets: ESL.mixture.rda, TBnanostring.rds
